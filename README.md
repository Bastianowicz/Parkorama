# Parkorama
A little peace of code for showing panoramas on a map. It is more of a beta at the moment

## Features
- Display any number of nodes on the map
- click the nodes for panorama view in a lightbox
- add new nodes
- move nodes
- rotate nodes
- copy config-JSON to paste in Javascript-file to save new or edited nodes
- drag & scroll on map and panoramas

## Usage
just clone the repo and edit everything for your needs. Replace the map and add your own nodes. 
Currently it shows panoramas of the city-park in Wurzen, Germany.
To enable the GUI for editing the existing nodes just set showControls to true.
You can either use the JSON inside main.js for moving and editing the nodes or use the functions in the GUI.

## Shortcuts
- Mark a editable not by clicking it
- rotate a marked node with arrow keys
- drag & drop marked nodes
- press enter to finish editing
- click "Anordnug kopieren" to copy the current JSON (yes it needs a international version =) )


## Support
It is far from finished by now but fits the purpose I implemented it in first place. So feel free to modify and extend it for your purposes.
